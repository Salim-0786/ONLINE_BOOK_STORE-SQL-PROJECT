ðŸš€ Leveling Up My Data Analytics Skills with SQL! ðŸ“Š

I'm excited to share my recent hands-on SQL project: Online Bookstore Data Analysis! ðŸ“šðŸ’»

As part of my journey to strengthen my skills in data analytics, I dove into a real-world scenario involving an online bookstore's database. Through this project, I explored various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from raw dataâ€”and hereâ€™s a glimpse of what I learned:

âœ… Identified top-selling and most frequently ordered books
âœ… Analyzed customer behavior based on location and order history
âœ… Filtered data by genres like Fiction and Fantasy
âœ… Calculated stock management insights post-order fulfillment
âœ… Discovered revenue trends based on high-value customers

This project helped me better understand how to manipulate, analyze, and summarize data using SQL, turning complex data into actionable insights!

Big thanks to the data community and all the learning resources that made this possible. ðŸ™Œ
Always hungry to learn moreâ€”next stop: data visualization and dashboarding! ðŸš€
